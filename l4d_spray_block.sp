Blocks client sprays.
It is suggested to also set the following in the server.cfg file:

sm_cvar sv_allowupload 0
sm_cvar sv_allowdownload 0

Although many players have interesting sprays, there are an increasing number of players/griefers who are using custom sprays that are unbelievably disgusting or hateful/political in nature. So much so that I decided to just block all sprays as I am tired of people trying to ruin the fun and enjoyment of playing L4D(2).

I suspect there are similar plugins out there somewhere, but this is what I'm using and thought I would share. I am not taking feature requests at this time, but please let me know if it is not working and/or you get any errors.
